* Training Stress Score
TSS = (sec x NP® x IF®)/(FTP x 3600) x 100

NP - normalized power
if - intensity factor
FTP is functional threshold power (berst average power for one-hour race or test)
sec is duration of the workout in seconds

TSS per hour by REP:
1 - 20
2 - 30
3 - 40
4 - 50
5 - 60
6 - 70
7 - 80
8 - 100
9 - 120
10 - 140
